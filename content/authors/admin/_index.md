As a postgraduate student at Ningbo University, Peng majored in the sex development mechanisms of the crustaceans, in specific, DM domain genes of the Chinese mitten crab, *Eriocheir sinensis*.

Also, Peng equipped himself with bioinformatics, and could handle with Perl & R flexibly.

In the research, Peng got obsessed with the alluring sex development mechanisms underlying the animal kingdom and was driven to revealing more essences and contributing to the human cognition.
