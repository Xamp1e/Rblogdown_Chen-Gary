abstract: The doublesex and male-abnormal 3 related transcriptional factor (Dmrt) gene family is an integration of DM domain genes, which are known for regulating sex development prevalently in animal kingdom. Here we made a study of the Dmrt gene family in the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, a decapod whose sex development mechanism still remains a mystery. A multi-transcriptomic analysis identified seven novel and confirmed two known Dmrt genes in the crab. Each EsDmrt gene contained at least one DM domain while an additional oligomerization domain was predicted for E. sinensis Doublesex (EsDsx1 and EsDsx2). Sequence analysis indicated that, the Dmrt genes were highly conserved in different species. Moreover, in adult gonads, most EsDmrt genes exhibited a biased expression to male and both iDmrt1 and Dsx homologs were prominent for an abundant transcription in androgenic gland (AG) relative to testis. The male-biased expression of EsDmrts suggested that, EsDmrts play a vital role in AG development and male sexual characters.  Especially, EsDsx1 was highly respected for its unique alternative splicing (AS) model, which resulted in one common and two male-specific splicing isoforms. Besides, a putative splicing pattern of EsDsx1 pre-mRNA was proposed based on relevant cis- and trans- acting elements. Study of EsDsx1 revealed that, the EsDsx1 might be a key factor in gender pathway and regulated by some upstream genes. Our study on the E. sinensis would provide sights of an ancient and conserved gene family in regulating decapod sex development. And the male-specific splicing pattern of EsDsx1 pre-mRNA would illuminate the mechanism underlying molecular interaction in sex development.
